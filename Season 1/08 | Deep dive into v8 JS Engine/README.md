## V8 JavaScript Engine: Code Execution Phases

The **V8 JavaScript Engine** follows a series of phases to execute JavaScript code efficiently. This process includes parsing, interpreting, optimizing, and garbage collecting to ensure high performance.

---

## 1. Parsing Stage

- **Lexical Analysis**: V8 starts by reading the JavaScript code and breaking it down into **tokens**. These tokens are small building blocks like keywords, operators, and identifiers.
- **Syntax Analysis**: The tokens are then arranged into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, which is a tree-like structure that represents the code's logic and syntax.

---

## 2. Ignition (Interpreter)

- **Bytecode Generation**: V8 converts the AST into **bytecode**‚Äîa simpler, intermediate form of the code that's easier to execute.
- **Execution**: The **Ignition interpreter** runs this bytecode directly, enabling the code to start executing quickly, but without yet being fully optimized for maximum performance.

---

## 3. Profiling

- **Hotspot Detection**: As the code runs, V8 profiles its execution to identify **hot functions**, which are parts of the code that are executed frequently. This profiling allows V8 to gather data to make optimization decisions.

---

## 4. TurboFan (Optimizing Compiler)

- **Optimization**: For the frequently used "hot" code paths, V8 employs the **TurboFan compiler** to convert bytecode into highly optimized **machine code**, making it run much faster.
- **Deoptimization**: If assumptions used for optimization turn out to be wrong (e.g., a variable type changes), V8 can revert the optimized code back to a slower, but safer, execution mode.

---

## 5. Garbage Collection

- **Memory Management**: V8 uses **garbage collection** to clean up memory. It regularly removes objects that are no longer in use, ensuring efficient memory management and preventing memory leaks.

---

## 6. Final Execution

- **Execution**: The optimized machine code continues to run efficiently, ensuring the best possible performance until the program completes or code changes require re-optimization.
